# Compose-paging-demo
This demo project deals with efficient API call optimization using Paging3 Caching, referencing the linked repository's basic clean architecture layer configuration and some content. (https://github.com/philipplackner/ComposePaging3Caching)

This demo project covers additional tasks in addition to the content of the linked repository.

To make it easy to configure the project architecture into a Multi-Module, DI directory is set up for each core and designed to inject the network's API service and Database DAO separately.

---

The app architecture has three layers :: a data layer, a domain layer and a UI layer.

## Example: Displaying Paging3 Caching Beer Data
